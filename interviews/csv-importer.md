# Exercise 1: The CSV Importer

We would like you to write an application (Rails or Node, whatever you prefer) that takes a CSV file of albums and sorts them by release date.

1. The application should provide an interface to upload the CSV file (dirk?) 
2. The uploaded file should be parsed into a database (MySQL, Mongo, or Postgres â€“ your choice)
3. After upload, the application should render the new list of albums sorted by `Release Year`

Export this [Sample CSV](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k9qlMWLqZ0fNuZDuVnT_wplk33JHq732mfq32FgKHzM/edit#gid=0) from Google Sheets. 

### Requirements

The only requirement is that we can see the application live on the internet. [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) is a great option for Rails and Node application hosting.

### Next Steps

Once the application is complete, send us the link to the application and the link to your Github repository of the code. We'll schedule a time to talk immediately.
