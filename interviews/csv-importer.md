# Exercise 1: The CSV Importer

We would like you to write an application (Rails or Node, whatever you prefer) that takes a CSV file of albums and sorts them by release date.

1. The application should provide an interface to upload the CSV file (dirk?) 
2. The uploaded file should be parsed into a database (MySQL, Mongo, or Postgres â€“ your choice)
3. After upload, the application should render the new list of albums sorted by `Release Year`

A sample CSV is [available for exporting](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k9qlMWLqZ0fNuZDuVnT_wplk33JHq732mfq32FgKHzM/edit#gid=0) out of Google Sheets.
