# Guidelines at Mindspace

Things to read and know before committing code at Mindspace. This is like 0% thought through so far. Something we are working on.

A few guideline note:

1. Don't use Yeoman, please.
2. Modularize your Gruntfile using autoload tasks and autoconfig stuffs. Will document here.
3. Modularize your Javascript, use jQuery sparingly and don't submit long jQuery callback hell files. use grunt to concat.
4. Comment your code, use DocBlockr.
