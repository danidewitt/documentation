# Mindspace Documentation

This is a repo that stores documents we use for development interviews (junior and senior) as well as any other public facing information about the development team. 

A few guidelines to note:

1. Don't use Yeoman, please.
2. We use Grunt, not Gulp.
2. Modularize your Gruntfile using [auto load tasks](https://github.com/sindresorhus/load-grunt-tasks) and [auto config](https://github.com/firstandthird/load-grunt-config) stuffs. 
3. Modularize your Javascript, use jQuery sparingly and don't submit long jQuery callback hell files. 
4. Comment your code, use [DocBlockr Sublime plugin](https://github.com/spadgos/sublime-jsdocs).
